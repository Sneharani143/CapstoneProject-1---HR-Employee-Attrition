## Capstone-Project-1---HR-Employee-Attrition

#### Project End Goal:

1. For CLient IBM, predict the Employee Attrition based on listed factors and derive model that can predict Employee chances of leaving the company.

2. Need to analyse and provide analysis on contribution of varied factors to Attrition and derive factos which contributed the most.

#### Client details and their need details. How this project findings can help them?

For Companies ,Attrition is problem which adds unwanted cost and reduces productivity of a company.So, with work they would come to know factors that contribute to Attrition and they can then develop measures to reduce attrition.

#### Project Data Source
My Dataset consists of 35 features and over 1470 rows prepared by IBM Data Scientist. We are going to use the data present in the link:
